# If new data types need to be defined, they have to be put in a separate C++
# header, and this header will be loaded here
import_types_from "port_statisticsTypes.hpp"
# Finally, it is pretty common that headers are directly loaded from an external
# library. In this case, the library must be first used (the name is the
# library's pkg-config name) and then the header can be used. Following Rock
# conventions, a common use-case would be:
#
using_library "telemetry_provider"
# import_types_from "port_statistics/CustomType.hpp"

# If this project uses data types that are defined in other oroGen projects,
# these projects should be imported there as well.
